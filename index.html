    <hr size="3" noshade>
    <h3>Origin of Typhoon Ulysses</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="gab">On November 8, 2020, The JMA and PAGASA tracked a new tropical depression 132 nautical miles north-northwest of Palau.</li>
      <li class="gab">Few days later, JMA and PAGASA upgraded Ulysses into a severe tropical storm. On November 11, 2020, the first landfall occurred in the small island town of Patnanungan, Quezon.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr size="3" noshade>
    <h3>The path of the typhoon using geographical coordinates</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="gab">The location of the center of Ulysses is over the mid-western part of the central Philippine sea.</li>
      <li class="gab">The coordinates of Ulysses is 14.3 degrees North and 127.3 degrees East</li>
    </ul>
    <hr size="3" noshade>
    <h3>The wind of speed of the typhoon as it moves in the Philippines</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class="gab">Ulysses has sustained winds of 118–220 km/h and 64–119 knots</li>
      <li class="gab">Ulysses carries 356 mm of rain for the whole day of November 12. About 5,184,824 persons from Region 1–3, CALABARZON, MIMAROPA, Region V, CAR and NCR were affected

        <td ><h3>Effects of landforms and bodies of water on the covered typhoon
    </h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="gab">The body of water which is the Philippine sea, strengthens the typhoon because its a warm body of water which typhoons need to be stronger. Lands weaken the typhoon because there is no body of water to make the typhoon stronger
      </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why the Philippines is prone to typhoons</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="gab">The Philippines is located just above the equator and faces the western Pacific, with little else to absorb the energy of storms before they hit land. </li>
          <li class="gab">Storms are fuelled by the warm, tropical waters, which produce roughly 20 typhoons each year.</li>
          <li class="gab">The Philippines has the world’s hottest ocean temperatures – frequently above 28°C, the minimum temperature for typhoon formation
  </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparedness before, during, and after the typhoon</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="gab">Before: Listen to weather updates and advisories, Keep watch for warnings and plans regarding evacuation in your community, Prepare survival kits
  </li>
          <li class="gab">During: Stay at home or in a safe place. If you really have to leave your home, avoid areas that are prone to flooding or landslides. Watch out also for flying objects and debris, Keep yourself updated on the latest weather news. Keep all food and water containers covered and sealed.
  </li>
          <li class="gab">After: Stay in your place for a while until rescue services arrive, don’t go in the flood without any protection, and be careful of debris.</li>
        </ul>
